LL: Find Kth Node From End (âš¡Interview Question)
Implement the find_kth_from_end function, which takes the LinkedList (ll) and an integer k as input, and returns the k-th node from the end of the linked list WITHOUT USING LENGTH.

If the linked list has fewer than k items, the program should return None.

The find_kth_from_end function should follow these requirements:

The function should utilize two pointers, slow and fast, initialized to the head of the linked list.

The fast pointer should move k nodes ahead in the list.

If the fast pointer becomes None before moving k nodes, the function should return None, as the list is shorter than k nodes.

The slow and fast pointers should then move forward in the list at the same time until the fast pointer reaches the end of the list.

The function should return the slow pointer, which will be at the k-th position from the end of the list.

Pseudo Code:

initialize slow and fast pointers to the head of the linked list



for i in range k:

    if fast pointer is None:

        return None (list is shorter than k)

    move fast pointer to the next node



while fast pointer is not None:

    move slow pointer to the next node

    move fast pointer to the next node



return the slow pointer (k-th node from the end)
